# Tune Code

ðŸŽ¼ TuneCode is a web programming language for music creation, oriented towards people with experience in the use of software dedicated to music production (DAW: Digital Audio Workstations). Using analogous concepts to DAW's, TuneCode allows the playback of melodies through basic oscillators, the scheduling of samples and the use of effects.
